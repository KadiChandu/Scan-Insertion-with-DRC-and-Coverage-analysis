# Scan-Insertion-with-DRC-and-Coverage-analysis
This project implements a scan verification architecture in Verilog HDL, built around a modular DFT (Design for Test) design. The core logic supports scan-chain shifting, reset behavior, functional path isolation, and data transformation using encoders and decoders.
